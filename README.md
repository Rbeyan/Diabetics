# Insulin advisor with meal announcement using deep Reinforcement Learning

Project for diabetics management by YR,NL,PB
This project aims to compare two RL models, one without meal detection and one with meal detection. 
For this purpose the basic implementations the [T1D simulator](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose) was used. 
The project is based on previous projects [RL-Project](https://github.com/miopp2/diabetes-RL-project/tree/main) and [Meal Detection](https://github.com/bodging/DiabetsTechMeatDetection) which were updated (due to simglucose updates), adapted and combined.
